These CellBlender codes are used to create 3D Monte Carlo reaction-diffusion models in which the surface density of glial glutamate transporters was varied between 0 and 20,000 um-2. In these simulations, the walls of the worlds (the cube in which the simulation is run) are set as transparent. Files whose name includes the suffix "_far" and "_close" refer to simulations in which the glutamate release site was located far or close with respect to the surrounding astrocyte sheet.
