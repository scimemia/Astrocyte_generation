The file named "astro_measures" is the main MATLAB code. 
When run, it accesses the other files, and simulates a cell. 
It produces a figure with the 3D structure of an astrocyte with spherical soma, and branches color-coded according to their branching level. 
The code also calculates cell measures (Sholl profile, number of branches, average branch lengths, etc) as specified in the line by line comments). 

The code needs to specify key parameters for the cell, such as the number of primary branches P (between 3 and 7), the number of branch levels N, the bias f in the application of the 3/2 rule, the length and frequency of leaves on the branch segment. 
The function of each of these parameters is specified in the line by line comments.
The code “plotting_average,” if run after “astro_measures,” stores the values of the computed measures, and plots the Sholl profile, the average number of branches and the average branch length per level.
