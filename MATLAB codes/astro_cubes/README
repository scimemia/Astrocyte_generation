The file named "astro_cubes” is the main MATLAB code. When run, it accesses the other files, and simulates a cell. 
It produces a figure with the 3D structure of an astrocyte with spherical soma, and branches color-coded according to their branching level. 
It records the surface area and volume of all branch levels and leaves, and computes separately the volume of the cell core structure (in the variable “Volcore”). 
At the end of the run, the code prints the ratio of Volcore versus the whole cell volume.

The code also produces a rectangular, equidistant partition of the 3-dimensional space occupied by the cell (for a fixed step size “stp”), and extracts a minimal collection of cubes that covers all branches in the non-core structure of the cell (a cube subcover). 
The 3D model cell is then plotted in a figure, together with the cube subcover of the noncore structure. 
The ratio of the volume of the non-core structure versus the volume of the subcover surrounding it (neuropil) is calculated and printed at the ends of the run.
