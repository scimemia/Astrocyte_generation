The file named "astro_cubes” is the main MATLAB code. When run, it accesses the other files, and generates a 3D model of an astrocyte. 
The model astrocyte has a spherical soma, and branches color-coded according to their level. 
The code records the surface area and volume of all branches, tips and leaves, and computes separately the volume of the cell core structure (in the variable “Volcore”). 
The core structure is composed of the soma and stems.
At the end of the run, the code prints the ratio of Volcore versus the whole cell volume, so the proportion of the non-core regions can be calculated as 1-Volcore.

The code also produces a rectangular, equidistant partition of the 3D volume occupied by the astrocyte (for a fixed step size “stp”), and extracts a minimal collection of cubes that covers all branches in the non-core regions (a cube subcover). 
The 3D model astrocyte is then plotted in a figure, together with the cube subcover of the non-core structure. 
The ratio of the volume of the non-core structure versus the volume of the subcover surrounding it (neuropil) is calculated and printed at the end of the run.
