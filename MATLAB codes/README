The file named "cell_3D_octahedron_10_10_21" is the main MATLAB code. When run, it accesses the other files, and generates the 3D geometry of an astrocyte, with leaves and branches color-coded according to their branching level. 
The code also calculates a number of astrocyte measures (e.g., Sholl profile, number of branches, average branch lengths, as specified in the line by line comments). 
The code creates up to P=7 primary branches. To change the number of primary branches, change the value of P accordingly, and comment out the unused branches.
